### Question

How to find a well worth airbnb room NewYork?

### Data Set

There are three main date sets:

1. **Listing**

   Detailed Listings data for New York City with over 300,00 rows of data and 74 features.

2. **Calender**

### Prblems

Currently there is no convenient way for a new Airbnb host to decide the price of his or her listing. New hosts must often rely on the price of neighbouring listings when deciding on the price of their own listing.

### Our Goal

Our goal is to help people to find a well worth airbnb room in New York by predicting the airbnb price and figuring out what is the top factors that influence the different price.

By using the data set above, we are able to find the relations between different features and price, also we are able to predict the trend of the price based on different features. A new host is able to use our model to find a suggested price for the airbnb room he want to choose.

At last we will draw a conclusion and give useful advice based on our work.

### Possible knowledge may be used

*Data cleaning, Feature engineering, Linear/Nonlinear models and etc.*

### Project Value

Whether the room I live in is worth the price I paid is a question that many people on business trips or travel are very concerned. This project analyzes Airbnb listings in the New York City to better understand how different attributes such as bedrooms, location, house type amongst others can be used to accurately predict the price of a new listing that is optimal in terms of the hostâ€™s profitability yet affordable to their guests. Our model is intend to predict the price of this airbnb room based on some characteristics, so it can help users to choose the most suitable room for them, thereby improving the happiness of travelers. Furthermore, if our data set can be richer, the computing power is more powerful, and the algorithm used is more complex, then our model will eventually be more accurate. Such a model can not only better help travelers choose airbnb rooms in New York, but also can applied to the entire hotel industry accross the world to help hotels improve their pricing system.
