##### Question

How to find a well worth airbnb room?

##### Our Goal

Our goal is to help people to find a well worth airbnb room by predicting the airbnb price across the US and figuring out what is the top factors that influence the different price.

##### Project Value

Whether the room I live in is worth the price I paid is a question that many people on business trips or travel are very concerned. Our model can predict the price of this airbnb room based on some characteristics, so it can help users to choose the most suitable room for them, thereby improving the happiness of travelers. Furthermore, if our data set can be richer, the computing power is more powerful, and the algorithm used is more complex, then our model will eventually be more accurate. Such a model can not only better help travelers choose airbnb rooms, but also can applied to the entire hotel industry to help hotels improve their pricing system.
